    <p data-translate="map_para1">Tirana is more than just the capital of Albania—it is the heart of the country's history, transformation, and collective memory. A city that has witnessed decades of change, resilience, and cultural evolution, Tirana stands as a symbol of progress and identity.</p>
    <p data-translate="map_para2">Through Kujto Tiranën, we chose Tirana as the home for our time capsule because it encapsulates the spirit of an entire nation. From its layered history to its rapid modernization, every street, building, and story holds a piece of Albania's past, present, and future. By preserving memories here, we honor the experiences of generations, ensuring that the essence of Tirana is never forgotten.</p>
    <p data-translate="map_para3">This city is where personal and collective narratives intertwine—where history meets the future. That's why Tirana.</p>
